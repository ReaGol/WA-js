//? “Write a function to return an n element in Fibonacci sequence” is one of the most common questions you can hear during the coding challenge interview part.
//?  In this blogpost I’m going to walk through the two of the most typical solutions for this problem and also cover
//?  a dreadful (for most of novice developers) topic of time complexity.
//? So what is a Fibonacci sequence? According to ​Wikipedia​:
//? “In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence,
//? and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.”
//? Depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence (0 or 1) the sequence would look like this:
//? 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
//? or this:
//? 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

function fibonacci(num) {
  let num1 = 0;
  let num2 = 1;
  let sum;

  for (let i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    sum = num1 + num2;
    num1 = num2;
    num2 = sum;
    console.log(num2);
  }
}
